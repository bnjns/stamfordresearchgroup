    <p>Launched in 1983 as <em>Containerisation International Research</em>, the Stamford Research Group is an
      independent, specialist, freight transport business consultancy deploying a full range of skills in business
      development, economics and forecasting, new product and service development, marketing, market research and
      analysis, business strategy, finance, investment appraisal, due diligence, and management consultancy.</p>
    <p>The companyâ€™s original focus was on international through transport, and therefore on container shipping and
      ports, inland distribution by rail, road, and inland waterway: and on the infrastructure, equipment, and services
      associated with the container transport industry. Although container transport remains our dominant client sector,
      over time SRG has expanded into most other freight transport sectors, including airfreight and bulk shipping and
      ports. We now cover all freight modes and the transport of all commodity types.</p>
    <p>Our clients include ports and shipping lines, railfreight companies, financial institutions, equipment
      manufacturers and leasing companies, global civil engineering and management consultancies, and governments and
      government agencies.</p>
    <p>Our projects typically involve the development of business strategies based on market research results, and
      similarly use market research techniques as a significant input to the statistical modelling required for the
      development of traffic or sales forecasts and scenarios, and for financial and economic appraisals.</p>
    <p>We are dedicated to delivering commercially viable solutions, and to providing our clients with independent and
      objective advice in all our work.</p>
