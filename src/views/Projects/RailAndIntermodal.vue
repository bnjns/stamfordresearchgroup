    <h3>FINESSE </h3>
    <p>EU Interreg funded FINESSE project – an examination of the potential for developing rail/sea trade between the UK
      and the European mainland on behalf of a group of British, French, and Belgian regional government and port
      authorities, requiring in-depth analysis of trade flows and modal choice on possible pathways, and the development
      of a commercially viable niche alternative to the Channel Tunnel, Based on economic and financial analysis and a
      wide ranging market research programme amongst market players.</p>
    <h3>Channel Tunnel intermodal strategies </h3>
    <p>Several strategic studies of potential Channel Tunnel freight markets for European railways and Intercontainer
      carried out between 1987 and 1993. Targeting commodities, shippers, transport operators, and routes demanded
      forecasts and analysis of international trade and transport data by inland region and large personal and telephone
      interview programmes amongst shippers, hauliers, and forwarders across Europe. Logistics operators’ attitudes to
      intermodalism, and their perceptions of rail competitivity, were assessed for Railfreight Distribution’s Channel
      Tunnel Strategy Group. The effect of the 44 tonne intermodal concession on demand for the Tunnel service, and on
      the availability of appropriate equipment, was examined. The Europe-wide availability of palletwide containers,
      swap-bodies, container chassis, and drawbar units was investigated, and the implications for the Channel Tunnel
      marketing effort was assessed, as was the current and probable future importance of over-height container and
      swap-body equipment in European freight transport. Operational, terminal location and marketing strategy
      development studies were carried out for Intercontainer, while other studies examined the impact of Tunnel shuttle
      and intermodal services on ports.</p>
    <h3>Business forecasts for and viability of Hong Kong port rail link </h3>
    <p>Evaluation of business and infrastructure plans for direct rail link between Kwai Chung and a Shenzhen freight
      yard, designed to carry mainland Chinese traffic to Hong Kong Port.</p>
    <h3>Profitability of European market development </h3>
    <p>Assessment of long-term European profit potential for advanced technology freight wagon bogies, based on
      extensive research amongst buyers, users, and authorities. Re-evaluation after modification of client’s design in
      light of earlier advice.</p>
    <h3>Europe/Far East trade and transport </h3>
    <p>Comparative cost and operational evaluation of sea, rail, and road options for trade between Europe and the Far
      East/Central Asia, focussing on railway options.</p>
    <h3>Dibden Bay rail share</h3>
    <p>Advice to Hampshire County Council on the potential rail container share of throughput achieved as a result of
      terminal development at Dibden Bay, Southampton in support of its case against development.</p>
    <h3>New Europe/Gulf/India rail service</h3>
    <p>Development of series of project proposals in connection with proposed NOSTRAC intermodal rail link between West
      Europe and India/Persian Gulf. The initial idea proposed using 3-deck rail ferries in the Caspian Sea and Persian
      Gulf.</p>
    <h3>Combined transport terminal development </h3>
    <p>Study of the potential volume and market development for a Channel Tunnel service between the UK and a Muizen
      terminal serving its Belgian/German hinterland.</p>
    <h3>Combined transport terminal development </h3>
    <p>Study of the potential for a TGV/Channel Tunnel option for transit between the UK and the carriers' air hub at
      Zaventem, Belgium, converting UK parcels traffic from air to rail.</p>
